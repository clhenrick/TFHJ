This satisfied Norman and he left.

Also, she claims the MHA told her that instead of being able to buy shares in her apartment for $250 (the low income building is going co-op), the MHA said she has to pay $1,800 because she missed the deadline, which was the end of July.  She provided a copy of a $100 money order, payable to the attorney, Goldstein Hall, on Feb. 28, 2011 as a deposit for her unit.

He said that the attorney sent back her $100 deposit in the mail because she sent it in February without an accompanying purchase agreement.  They should have been sent at the same time.  She did not sign until May.  So, he said, she should bring in the $100 money order again, and the MHA will recognize her right to purchase for $250.  

As for her rent, the MHA checked their records and she was a couple of months past due at the end of August, so her rent check paid on September 1st was applied to July, and she still owes 2 months.  

On 9/22, Ms. Quinones came by the office to say that she agreed she owed back rent, and she made a partial payment with the MHA building liaison.  She still owes a little bit and they will let her get caught up next month with the balance owed.

He accused me of having another primary residence and said he would not make any repairs to my apt. He then offered me a small amount of money to move and gave me 12 weeks to leave. I explained to the management located directly downstairs that the accusations were false. I had several roommates in the summer of 2010 but there was never a sublet. During the next several weeks I was frequently called and stopped on the street by several members of the management and was told I had to negotiate terms and sign the buyout or face eviction. I unfortunately gave in to this pressure and impetuously signed the buyout agreement without a lawyer or court proceeding. I almost immediately began writing letters urging the management to dismiss this buyout and allow me to return to living in peace. They refused. In March 2011 I called in inspectors and for the first time in 25 years violations were documented. I then brought the management to Housing Court where they were ordered to make repairs on June 17th. I was given to Dec 31st to leave but the landlord has refused to comply with the court order and many of the violations remain unresolved. I recently received a letter from the landlord’s attorney threatening to commence Hold Over Eviction if I did not comply with the terms of the buyout. They have not accepted rent since Oct 2010. Unfortunately I no longer have the funds to fully pay them back or to retain a lawyer to help with my defense. During the last several months my privacy has been invaded. I was contacted by an attorney who knew me from High School. He first offered to help at no cost but then seemed to be in collusion with the landlord’s attorney. He stole documents pertaining to the case among other things and I formerly dismissed him on April 28th .; If I have to leave my home and business ( I record compose and teach in my apt. )  I am worried that I will not be able to find a place to live .

http://tenant.net/Court/Howcourt/heat.html
You should be keeping a record like it details there; it actually says to call 311 everyday.

Getting Your Security Deposit
1. written request for it, certified mail, with a return receipt. 
2. If there's no response to that, then you can file a complaint with the NYS Atty General's office (see Rent Security Deposit Complaint Form)
3. if no response to that, take LL to Small Claims Court.

Notes
For your reference, here is the best way you could have gone about all this. First you should have sent a certified letter to the landlord (LL) about the situation. The most effective way to resolve heat/hot water issues is to take your LL to Housing Court, with an HP Action. This forces them to correct the situation.

You can only withhold a portion of your rent for no heat/hot water. This portion is usually from 10%-40%. The portion you plan to withhold should have been stated in the aforementioned letter to your LL.
While the LL can not sue you for back rent once you move out, depending on what your lease says, he can take it out of your security deposit.",Daniel,CR,,,,,,NEW,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,2,,,,

I've read online about your organization helping people out in these kinds of situations and I was wondering what my rights were. My building turned off the cooking gas about a month ago. It has still not turned back on and they keep lying to us about progress. What rights do I have in this situation?
Yes. There was a leak and the gas was turned off. I have called 311 multiple times and the address is 22 st. Marks place.

Hi Samantha, you should send a letter to your landlord, certified mail with return receipt. In it, say they have, for example, a week from receipt of the letter, to give you a firm timeline of progress or you will file an HP Action in Housing Court. I advise you do this ASAP to get the process going.

(An HP Action is something you can file yourself, for $45, in Housing Court. In it, the landlord is called to court to remedy the situation.  It can be filed either by individual tenants, or the group of tenants as a whole. More info here.)

Let me know if you need anything else. If you want, we can set up an appointment for you to speak with one of my staff. Next available appt is Wednesday 1/30.",Daniel,CR,,,,,,NEW,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,3,,,,
