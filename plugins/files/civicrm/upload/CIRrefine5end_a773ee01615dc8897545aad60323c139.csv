You should be keeping a record like it details there; it actually says to call 311 everyday.

Getting Your Security Deposit
1. written request for it, certified mail, with a return receipt. 
2. If there's no response to that, then you can file a complaint with the NYS Atty General's office (see Rent Security Deposit Complaint Form)
3. if no response to that, take LL to Small Claims Court.

Notes
For your reference, here is the best way you could have gone about all this. First you should have sent a certified letter to the landlord (LL) about the situation. The most effective way to resolve heat/hot water issues is to take your LL to Housing Court, with an HP Action. This forces them to correct the situation.

You can only withhold a portion of your rent for no heat/hot water. This portion is usually from 10%-40%. The portion you plan to withhold should have been stated in the aforementioned letter to your LL.

I've read online about your organization helping people out in these kinds of situations and I was wondering what my rights were. My building turned off the cooking gas about a month ago. It has still not turned back on and they keep lying to us about progress. What rights do I have in this situation?
Yes. There was a leak and the gas was turned off. I have called 311 multiple times and the address is 22 st. Marks place.

Hi Samantha, you should send a letter to your landlord, certified mail with return receipt. In it, say they have, for example, a week from receipt of the letter, to give you a firm timeline of progress or you will file an HP Action in Housing Court. I advise you do this ASAP to get the process going.

(An HP Action is something you can file yourself, for $45, in Housing Court. In it, the landlord is called to court to remedy the situation.  It can be filed either by individual tenants, or the group of tenants as a whole. More info here.)
