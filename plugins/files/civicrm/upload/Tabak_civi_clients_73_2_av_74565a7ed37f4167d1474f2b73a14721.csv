However, she moved out about 5 years ago. I have contacted Tabak management numerous times to remove her name from the lease but they never did. My name is solely listed on all utility bills, rent checks and lease renewals.  I am still a bit worry, will this affect my rent stabilized status? // I'm not sure if I should contact the Tabak's to remove the old roommates name at this point. // YT: If the tenant requested it in writing at some point - i.e., has tangible proof of at least one request - he/she should be fine. If they haven't, they should mail a certified letter (return receipt) to the LL, requesting the roommate's name be removed (w/the obvious reasons why).  Assuming Tabak accepts the mail but still does nothing... well, that should be good enough cover for Mui. Either way, I don't think it's a big deal. // MY: I will go ahead and send them a certified letter addressing this matter."

Sounds like it'll be an automatic violation. // 9-10-15, will he verbally ask her to leave? no DOB would have to issue VO.

However, the new LL have sent him a renewal lease with a rent of 2,806. He currently pays 1,997 and this is a preferential rent. 1) Can the new LL make him sign a new lease, even though his lease is not up?, 2) And what about his preferential rent? /// Andy asked if should send this letter to mgmt: Hi Alyssa, Your colleague asked me to send this to you. It is the contract agreement on a two year rent stabilized lease that runs out on 7 / 31 / 17 for 27 St Mark's Place, #4c. As you can see it was signed on 7 / 14 / 2015 and is valid for two years. It shows a preferential rate of 1,977.94 pm for this period which shall be offered for the entire term of the lease / tenancy. Accordingly, I will be paying 1,977.94 pm and will get the check out to you forthwith. There are two copies, one unsigned, which is easier to read. The previous landlords informed me that they have sent you the paper copy. I also enclose the letter from Brook Hill stating that the new management would not affect my lease in any way apart from a new address to send the check. /// DW relayed advice from YT: He's doing exactly what he needs to do - the letter can be sent out as-is.  Looks like they tried to under-cut him on his preferential rent. /// Andy: Good news. They relented the under-cut and am good for next two years preferential."
