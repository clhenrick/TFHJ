You may have a case to be Rent Stabilized and possibly to have your current rent only increased a little. Even if we saw the i-Cards, we do not go to court regularly here, so you need a lawyer to tell you how it would play out in court. Attached is a list of tenant-friendly lawyers, expect to pay about $350 for a consultation.

We recommend you do this ASAP, so that you are prepared if and when Croman talks to you.

Don't do anything yet with Croman. Wait til he's in touch with you. If he stops accepting your rent (stops depositing it, or returns it), that is a sign that he's looking into your case, but it does not mean he's evicting you. Once Croman takes some action, either you'd do something in court with your lawyer, or you'd write a letter to Croman to the effect of, ""I know my apt is stabilized, I'm ready to fight for it."" This may elicit an offer from Croman to buy you out of your apt. Should RS status be unwinnable, worst case scenario is that you'd have 30 days to move out. In terms of notice of when you have to move, be prepared to have only 30 days notice at any time, unfortunately. Staying past that, while physically possible, will most likely invoke court proceedings against you, and your placement on the blacklists we talked about.
