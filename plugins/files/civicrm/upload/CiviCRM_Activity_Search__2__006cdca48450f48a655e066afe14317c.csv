He asked who was the person he spoke with earlier, and then he and secretary bickered about someone who sometimes goes by Stan. She put him on hold intermittently, thus contributing to Norman's perception that she plays games. Finally, Daniel intervened and got the manager's assistant, and told them that stipulation states that inspectors must have state-issued ID (as opposed to Brownstone Mgmt ID). This satisfied Norman and he left. (Norman alleged that Jack's injuring him was more important than getting leak fixed, and that's why he pined on the technicality of people's names, instead of getting to the point with the secretary.); After Norman left, Jack called CSC, to say that he came, Norman did not like his assistant, so he got a different person to come.

He accused me of having another primary residence and said he would not make any repairs to my apt. He then offered me a small amount of money to move and gave me 12 weeks to leave. I explained to the management located directly downstairs that the accusations were false. I had several roommates in the summer of 2010 but there was never a sublet. During the next several weeks I was frequently called and stopped on the street by several members of the management and was told I had to negotiate terms and sign the buyout or face eviction. I unfortunately gave in to this pressure and impetuously signed the buyout agreement without a lawyer or court proceeding. I almost immediately began writing letters urging the management to dismiss this buyout and allow me to return to living in peace. They refused. In March 2011 I called in inspectors and for the first time in 25 years violations were documented. I then brought the management to Housing Court where they were ordered to make repairs on June 17th. I was given to Dec 31st to leave but the landlord has refused to comply with the court order and many of the violations remain unresolved. I recently received a letter from the landlord’s attorney threatening to commence Hold Over Eviction if I did not comply with the terms of the buyout. They have not accepted rent since Oct 2010. Unfortunately I no longer have the funds to fully pay them back or to retain a lawyer to help with my defense. During the last several months my privacy has been invaded. I was contacted by an attorney who knew me from High School. He first offered to help at no cost but then seemed to be in collusion with the landlord’s attorney. He stole documents pertaining to the case among other things and I formerly dismissed him on April 28th .; If I have to leave my home and business ( I record compose and teach in my apt. )  I am worried that I will not be able to find a place to live .

http://tenant.net/Court/Howcourt/heat.html<br />
You should be keeping a record like it details there; it actually says to call 311 everyday.<br />
<br />
Getting Your Security Deposit<br />
1. written request for it, certified mail, with a return receipt. <br />
2. If there's no response to that, then you can file a complaint with the NYS Atty General's office (see Rent Security Deposit Complaint Form)<br />
3. if no response to that, take LL to Small Claims Court.<br />
<br />
Notes<br />
For your reference, here is the best way you could have gone about all this. First you should have sent a certified letter to the landlord (LL) about the situation. The most effective way to resolve heat/hot water issues is to take your LL to Housing Court, with an HP Action. This forces them to correct the situation.<br />
<br />
You can only withhold a portion of your rent for no heat/hot water. This portion is usually from 10%-40%. The portion you plan to withhold should have been stated in the aforementioned letter to your LL.<br />
While the LL can not sue you for back rent once you move out, depending on what your lease says, he can take it out of your security deposit.",2765,Phone Call

Yes. There was a leak and the gas was turned off. I have called 311 multiple times and the address is 22 st. Marks place.<br />

Hi Samantha, you should send a letter to your landlord, certified mail with return receipt. In it, say they have, for example, a week from receipt of the letter, to give you a firm timeline of progress or you will file an HP Action in Housing Court. I advise you do this ASAP to get the process going.<br />
<br />
(An HP Action is something you can file yourself, for $45, in Housing Court. In it, the landlord is called to court to remedy the situation.  It can be filed either by individual tenants, or the group of tenants as a whole. More info here.)<br />
